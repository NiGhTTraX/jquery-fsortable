================

A fixed layout sortable plugin for jQuery UI.


Demo
----

Check http://nighttrax.github.io/jquery-fsortable/ for a demo.


#### IMPORTANT NOTE

The [jQuery UI sortable](http://jqueryui.com/sortable/) plugin (which fsortable
builds upon) currently has 2 bugs that affect fsortable when working
with connected sortables.

The first bug causes over and out events to not be triggered properly when
using connected sortables. See http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9335 for more
details.

The second bug causes change events to trigger on the sender list, rather
than on the current list, when dragging an item from a connected sortable.
See http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9760 for more details.

If you don't need connected sortables then you can use this plugin as is.
However, if you do require that functionality, then please use the following
repo until the fixes land upstream.

Usage
-----

Include ```jquery-fsortable.js``` in your project and call
```$("#my-div").fsortable()```. fsortable creates a ```sortable```
instance for you. You can call it on an existing instance by passing
```existingSortable: true``` in the options at creation time.

After you create the fsortable instance you can call methods on the
underlying sortable instance by passing them through the ```.sortable()```
wrapper. The plugin will still fire ```sort``` instance just like a normal
```sortable``` plugin.


Creating a fixed layout
-----------------------

There's some necessary markup you need to use to let fsortable know about
your layout. Since it assumes your sortable has a ```fixed capacity``` you
need to tell it how many items it can hold. It takes that information from
the HTML itself by counting the number of items in your sortable and the
number of empty positions.

Any item that matches the ```items``` option of the sortable plugin will be
counted as being part of the layout. Any item that has the ```emptyClass```
class will be counted as being a free slot. The sum of both will be the
total capacity of the sortable.

Let's take an example.

```html
<div id="mysortable">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div class="fsortable-empty"></div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

We've defined a layout with a total capacity of ```4```, that contains ```3```
items and ```1``` free slot. Once that free slot will be occupied (i.e. dragging
a ```draggable``` over it) the fsortable will become full and it will be marked
as being so by having the ```full``` class set on it.

If you need to change the size of the fsortable you can do so, but remember to
call the ```refresh``` method on it so it recalculates the items and free slots.

To connect draggables with your fsortable you need to do the following.

```javascript
$(".my-draggable").draggable({
  connectToSortable: ".fsortable:not(.full)"
});
```

Note the ```:not(.full)``` selector. That tells the draggables to not connect with
full fsortables.


Building
--------

Fsortable uses the [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) build system.
To build Fsortable, you must have [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node)
installed and then run the following commands:

```bash
# Install the Grunt CLI.
npm install -g grunt-cli

# Clone the repository.
git clone git@github.com:NiGhTTraX/jquery-fsortable.git
cd jquery-fsortable

# Install node module dependencies.
npm install

# Run the build task.
grunt
```

If all went well, you will find a minified version of the plugin in the ```build/``` folder.


Testing
-------

Run ```grunt test``` to run the tests in
[PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) or open ```tests/index.html```
to run them in your browser. Tests are written using the
[QUnit](http://www.qunitjs.com/) framework and the [jQuery Event Unit Testing
Helpers](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate).

To enable coverage, place the ```resources/``` and ```tests/``` folders in your
webserver and run the tests from there with the coverage option in QUnit checked
(running coverage locally will throw a cross-domain error). Coverage is done
using [blanket.js](http://www.blanketjs.org).
