{"name":"jquery-fsortable","tagline":"Fixed capacity sortable plugin","body":"jquery-fsortable\r\n================\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nInclude ```jquery-fsortable.js``` in your project and call\r\n```$(\"#my-div\").fsortable()```. fsortable creates a ```sortable```\r\ninstance for you. You can call it on an existing instance by passing\r\n```existingSortable: true``` in the options at creation time.\r\n\r\nAfter you create the fsortable instance you can call methods on the\r\nunderlying sortable instance by passing them through the ```.sortable()```\r\nwrapper. The plugin will still fire ```sort``` instance just like a normal\r\n```sortable``` plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating a fixed layout\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThere's some necessary markup you need to use to let fsortable know about\r\nyour layout. Since it assumes your sortable has a ```fixed capacity``` you\r\nneed to tell it how many items it can hold. It takes that information from\r\nthe HTML itself by counting the number of items in your sortable and the\r\nnumber of empty positions.\r\n\r\nAny item that matches the ```items``` option of the sortable plugin will be\r\ncounted as being part of the layout. Any item that has the ```emptyClass```\r\nclass will be counted as being a free slot. The sum of both will be the\r\ntotal capacity of the sortable.\r\n\r\nLet's take an example.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"mysortable\">\r\n  <div>Item 1</div>\r\n  <div>Item 2</div>\r\n  <div class=\"fsortable-empty\"></div>\r\n  <div>Item 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've defined a layout with a total capacity of ```4```, that contains ```3```\r\nitems and ```1``` free slot. Once that free slot will be occupied (i.e. dragging\r\na ```draggable``` over it) the fsortable will become full and it will be marked\r\nas being so by having the ```full``` class set on it.\r\n\r\nIf you need to change the size of the fsortable you can do so, but remember to\r\ncall the ```refresh``` method on it so it recalculates the items and free slots.\r\n\r\nTo connect draggables with your fsortable you need to do the following.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(\".my-draggable\").draggable({\r\n  connectToSortable: \".fsortable:not(.full)\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the ```:not(.full)``` selector. That tells the draggables to not connect with\r\nfull fsortables.\r\n\r\nFor full details checkout https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/jquery-fsortable/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
